# Auto_VR

 This is a simple prototype of an automobile in a showroom.
 Included options are:
- Select one of 3 cars
- Switch between outside and inside car views
- Rotation (outside the car only)
- Open doors and trunk
- Turn on lights (outside and inside the car)
- Open windows and activate wipers (inside the car only)

 If I was to implement a high-quality showroom with high-quality VR/AR hardware, I'd make lots of improvements, such as:
- better UI (showroom background with car on a rotating stand, more user-friendly controls, substitute menu buttons with interactive car elements, better graphics (car textures, shaders and lights), add sounds, transitions and animations, etc.)
- color selection of different elements of the car
- additions of the car equipment
- better memmory management
